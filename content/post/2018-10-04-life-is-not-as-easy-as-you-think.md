After I came to shanghai, I made a lot of friends. In my impression, students that are able to be admitted to Shanghai Jiaotong university are either talented or diligent.

# Of course I am the diligent one.
Looking back in my 5-year campus life, I deeply know that I'm not a talented students. What I can do is work harder than others.  
After I came to shanghai, people around me tend to enjoy their life rather than studying hard. And I, of course, am affected.  
All the good habits acuqired during my campus life have gone. It's obvious that getting rid off a good habit is easier than aquiring it.  
Although I know all of the secrets leading to success, I cannot control my self. Maybe that is why displine is cherishable.  
# From now on, I promise to work hard, think big.  
I have tried several times to find the best condition of myself. Maybe you don't know, in the past, I stay in the library all day along until 21:30 when the library close.  
However, things that's going on seem to be wrong and I know I have to make a change.  
The biggest obstacles in front of me is afraid of being outstanding and  asocial.  
So, let's face it bravely. If you ignore this problem currently, there will be another problem waiting you in the future.
