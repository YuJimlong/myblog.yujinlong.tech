# Is Shanghai really a good choice for me?
As a people living in Wenzhou for nearly 20 years, I decided to move to shanghai for better education and, maybe in the future, better salary.  
As for better salary, I have to admit that Shanghai never fail to meet my expectation. The first day I came to shanghai, I received 5000 yuan for my 4-week internship in the BIOHARMONY.  
However, as for research & education, the 6th people's hospital(I am studying at the hospital) is totally not a good choice. You know in Whenzhou, when I was an undergraduate student, my tutor has her own lab, that means we can carry the experiments whenever we want, but things here are totally different. A lot of my elder seniors have to use labs that is public or even owned by other research team. This kind of situation largely limit our freedom in doing research.  
Luckily, a new lab building is under construction. In that way, my worries should have been removed in the future.  
# I wanna talk about my roommates  
Our dormitory accommodates 6 students, all of us come from different part of China. Though sometimes we have cultural differences, we can get along well most of the time.  
# The public showring room is what I CANNOT accept at the begining.  
People from Southern China always use private bathroom, that means you take shower in a private space, however, it's common for Northern Chinese to take shower in a public space(with all the faucet collected in a large room.). Usually shanghai people are prone to take shower in a private bathroom. Nevertheless, because of the roaring housing price, our school cannot afford us a private bathroom, instead, I have to take shower in a public shower room. At first, I cannot accept everyone stand next to each other without a piece of clothe. But gradually, it's not a big deal in my opinion.  
I'm very glad that I can finnaly be so brave to stand nakedly in front of a crowd of people without feeling embarassed.
# About the food in shanghai  
Up to now, I have my meal in Student Canteen most of the time. But it's obvious that food price here is more expensive than price in Whenzhou.  
The same kind of meal in Whenzhou is only worth approximately 9-10RMB while here it's sold 12-14RMB.  
This high price phenomenon is within my expectation because people in this city receive a higher salary.  
# The pace of my life  
Every students here seems not as hardworking as student in WMU.(No wonder people say WMU is famous for her diligent students.)  
I officially came to my university on 2018-09-08 and it has been 3 weeks.  
Look back into the days I have spend, it seems, most of the time, I was playing basketball, playing e-games or celebrating something.  
To be honest, it makes my feel really guilty.  
# My plan for the future  
Maybe write a big paper and find a job in shanghai.  
Buy a house.  
Find a ***.
